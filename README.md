# Biotech-CodonProject
A little project that I worked on to get some coding experience.

It is written in Python.

The DNA you input has to already be the template 5' -> 3'. 
If you put the complimentary strand it will not read it correctly.

It has to be atleast two codons inclusive of the START codon and the STOP codon for the program to convert it to the mRNA transcription and to the amino acid translation. 

So, if you wanted to convert to a single amino acid, you would need the START codon then the codon of interest and finally the STOP codon. 

Ex: ATGCCCTAG -> AUGCCCUAG -> MP or MetPro

Let me know if I can make it better.
